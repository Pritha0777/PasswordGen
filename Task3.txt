#This file gives a detailed documentation/explanation of the code

We import random to generate random numbers which can be used to generate random passwords

1) generatePassword:
- "alphabet" is a string containing all lowercase letters.
- "passwords" is an empty list that will store the generated passwords.
- The function loops over each length in pwlength:
    For each length i, it initializes an empty string password.
    It then generates a password by appending random lowercase letters to password until it reaches 
the desired length "i".
    After generating the initial password, it calls "replaceWithNumber" and "replaceWithUppercaseLetter"
to modify the password.
    The modified password is added to the "passwords" list.
- Finally, the function returns the list of generated passwords.

2) replaceWithNumber:
- The for loop runs a random number of times between 1 and 2 (inclusive).
- In each iteration:
    A random index replace_index is chosen from the first half of the password.
    The character at this index is replaced with a random digit (0-9).
- After the loop completes all its iterations, the modified password is returned.

3) replaceWithUppercaseLetter:
- The for loop runs a random number of times between 1 and 2 (inclusive).
- In each iteration:
    A random index replace_index is chosen from the second half of the password.
    The character at this index is replaced with its uppercase version.
- After the loop completes all its iterations, the modified password is returned.

4) Main:
- The main function is the entry point of the program.
- It prompts the user to enter the number of passwords to generate.
- It initializes an empty list "passwordLengths".
- It asks the user for the desired length of each password, ensuring a minimum length of 3.
- It then calls "generatePassword" with the list of lengths to generate the passwords.
- Finally, it prints each generated password.
